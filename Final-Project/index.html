    <p class="common-info">(born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former football manager and player, best known for managing Manchester United from 1986 to 2013.
     He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time and has won more trophies than any other manager in the history of football.
     Ferguson is often credited for valuing youth during his time with Manchester United, particularly in the 1990s with the "Class of '92", 
     who contributed to making the club one of the richest and most successful in the world

        Ferguson then joined Rangers for £65,000, which was a record fee for a transfer between two Scottish clubs.
        He performed well in Europe during his two seasons with the club, scoring six goals in nine appearances in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup
         including two against 1.FC Köln in the 1967–68 competition, and an important strike against Athletic Bilbao in the 1968–69 edition
         which helped Rangers into the semi-finals, but on both occasions they were knocked out by English opposition. He was blamed for a goal
         conceded in the 1969 Scottish Cup Final, in a match in which he was designated to mark Celtic captain, Billy McNeill, and was
         subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team.
         According to his brother, Ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away

    <h3>Aberdeen Coach</h3>

    <p class="common-info">
        Ferguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982–83. They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result 
        of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out Bayern Munich, who had beaten Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 
        in the previous round. According to Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win 
        the competition, which they did, with a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the final on 11 May 1983.
        Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that "he'd done something worthwhile with his life".
        This was followed up with victory in the European Super Cup in December 1983, when Hamburger SV, the reigning European Cup champions, 
        were beaten 2–0 over two legs.
        Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1–0 victory over Rangers, 
        but Ferguson was not happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a "disgraceful performance" 
        in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted.

        After a sub-standard start to the 1983–84 season, Aberdeen's form improved and the team won the Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup.
        Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours,
        and was offered the managers' jobs at Rangers and Arsenal during the season. Aberdeen retained their league title in the 1984–85 season. 
        In 1985–86, Aberdeen won both domestic cups, but finished fourth in the league. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors 
        early in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer.
        
        Ferguson had been part of the coaching staff for the Scottish national side during qualifying for the 1986 World Cup, but manager Jock Stein
        had collapsed and died on 10 September 1985 – at the end of the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against
        Australia. Ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and subsequently at the World Cup.
        To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed Archie Knox as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to 
        progress past the group stages of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.
        
        Around this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson the chance to take over from Peter Shreeves as manager, but he rejected this offer 
        and the job went to Luton Town's David Pleat instead. There was also an offer for Ferguson to replace Don Howe as Arsenal manager, 
        but he rejected this offer as well, and fellow Scot George Graham took the post instead. That summer, there had been speculation that he 
        would take over from Ron Atkinson at Manchester United, who had slumped to fourth in the English top flight after a ten-match winning start.
        
        
        It was not the first time that Ferguson had been linked with a move to England. In February 1982, Wolverhampton Wanderers had 
        approached him about succeeding John Barnwell as manager as they were heading for relegation from the First Division. 
        He rejected this offer, perhaps concerned about the club's financial stability, as they were more than £2 million in debt at the time 
        and narrowly avoided going out of business. At the end of the 1984–85 season, it was reported that Ferguson was being considered for the 
        Liverpool manager's job after the retirement of Joe Fagan was announced, but the job was quickly accepted by Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.
     
        
        Although Ferguson remained at Aberdeen over the summer, he did eventually join Manchester United when Atkinson was sacked in November 1986

    <p class="common-info">
        Sir Alex Ferguson has a transformation al leadership style, which requires high standard of communication from management to meet desired 
        goals. He focuses on things in the long-run and motivates his team to achieve short-term successes.
        He developed 3 layers in which there were players who were above 30, and not younger than 23 in which the senior player will create
        standard and the younger ones would live up to them. Everything he did was to maintain the standards as a football club.
        He led from the front He was the first one on the field and never let his players give up, hence, boosting their expectations when needed. 
        He placed his trust in his team however,strongly believed that the control in the dressing room should not be with the players.
        The control must not be lost in the club as the manager must have control over his player that is what he always stood by and implemented.
        He had cut the cords of many players who were not contributing positively in the dressing room’s atmosphere.
        Under his management,if there will be anyone with control,then it would be him. With his control, he did not lose the touch of humanity; 
        he had control over the players but was not harsh to them. The messages he passed to the players were according to the situation. 
        Alex Ferguson never criticized any player. The advice which was to be conveyed in those halftime breaks was chosen wisely and carefully.
        Ferguson was restricted with his winning nature that he never wanted to loose, as he tried till the very last whistle and not gave
        in,which turned his defeats into victories.If he wasa goal behind and that there were5 minutes to the whistle, then he would change the
        nature of the game to attack mode and deploy attacking players knowing the risk of losing to a bigger margin however, hetried to convert 
        every match into a victory.
